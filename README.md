# Mini Games

This project is a culmination of my learning journey of different tech stacks and languages
These are end to end projects and can be used directly after installing them

## Features

These projects are pretty robust and built end to end as previously told, they are written in a pretty easy to understand manner and simple python

## Installation 

you can directly go ahead in you terminal of choice and type "git clone (the repo url here)" and then you will be good to go

hope you like it!
